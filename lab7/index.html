					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The assignment was straightforward. Understanding how sorting works based on case sensitivity was a bit difficult.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Fetching input as a variable to print along with the output was a bit tedious. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I focused on learning the usage of functions and understanding the console behaviour. There are quite few things I am not able to grasp with respect to how they work. </p>
