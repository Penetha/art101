                    <div id="challenge"></div>
                    <p>Tha lab was quite fun and it took time to figure out if all possible conditions have been satisfied. I tried exploring using multiple input fields and dynamic looping with the help of AI and Wes Bot.</p>

                    <p>I faced isssues while trying to format the input fields in columns. Also, there was an issue with the button click, which was a bit bizard as I could not figure out the reason as to why it did not work at times. </p>
