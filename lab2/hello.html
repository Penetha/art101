            <h1>Hello world</h1>
            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p1>I am Penetha Jayakumar, a 26 year-old female from India, who once was a clinical data manager in a scientific informatics company and now is a master's student in the department of Biomolecular engineering and Bioinformatics, looking forward with keen eyes and heart for a future in science and healthcare industry. Also, I am an amateur in pencil portrait drawing and my hobbies include reading, solving sudoku and random puzzles, doodling, and watching kdramas.</p1> 
            <h3>Why Art101?</h3>
            <p2>The little artist in me always wanted to learn art as a course and the curiosity to try web-designing (also the available window in my class schedule) led me to finally grab the opportunity to enroll in ART101 course.</p2>
            <h4>Do I like Art101?</h4>
            <p3>
                I am loving it so far. 
                <span1>It is pretty exciting to design webpages and to explore and learn new languages.</span1>
                <span2>The class is never boring and so much fun.</span2>
                <span3>And I get to work with a partner throughout the course, Sandy Strishak, who is pretty cool and fun.</span3>
